\section{Graph Theory: Motivation}

\subsection{Discrete systems}

Suppose there is a system $\mathcal{S}$ which updates discretely with time. Let every step i.e. discrete instant in time be labelled by an integer $n$ and the state of $\mathcal{S}$ at the concerned instant as $\sigma \left( n \right)$.

We can imagine that as time passes, $n$ increments in `jumps', as $n, n+1, n+2 \dots$. In accordance, $\sigma \left( n \right)$ updates as $\sigma \left( n \right), \sigma \left( n+1 \right), \sigma \left( n+2 \right), \dots$.

The coordinates of $\mathcal{S}$ at any instant $n$ are $\left( n, \sigma \left( n \right) \right)$. Let the set that $n$ belongs to be called its \emph{time domain}, $T \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$. Also, let $\sigma : T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Then, every coordinate $\left( n, \sigma \left( n \right) \right)$ belongs to $\Sigma = T \times \mathbb{R}$, called the \emph{state space} of $\mathcal{S}$.

The set of all possible coordinates of $\mathcal{S}$ (at different instants) in its state space $\Sigma$ is called its \emph{trajectory}, or \emph{history}. In set theoretic notation, the trajectory of $\mathcal{S}$ is $\left\{ \left( n, \sigma \left( n \right) \right) \vert n \in T \right\}$.

A visual way of representing the trajectory of a system is to plot the state $\sigma \left( n \right)$ as $n$ updates. For example, if a system's state starts at $0$ and updates by $1$ every unit time interval, its trajectory looks as shown:

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:1}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel style={below right},
    ylabel style={above left},
    xlabel = $n$,
    ylabel = {$\sigma \left( n \right) = n$},
    xmin=0,
    xmax=3.5,
    ymin=0,
    ymax=3.5,
    xtick={1,2,3},
    ytick={1,2,3},
    xmajorgrids = true
]

\addplot[
    color = blue,
    mark = *,
    mark options = {solid}
    ]
    coordinates {
    (0,0)(1,1)(2,2)(3,3)
    };

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Evolution of $\mathcal{S}$}
\end{figure}

In the above figure, the vertical lines indicate that $n$, shown along the x-axis, assumes discrete values. Namely, $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$. The state $\sigma$ at a given instant is given as $\sigma \left( n \right) = n$.

The kind of diagram above may be called a \emph{state update plot}.

\subsection{Update structure}

Much of a system's evolution can be pictured using its state update plot. However, it does not contain all the information necessary to understand the system's evolution. Let us see why.

What figure $\ref{fig:1}$ is really saying is that \emph{as $n$ updates discretely}, $\sigma$ updates discretely according to the diagram. While discerning the nature of $\mathcal{S}$ from its state update plot, we consider the update of $n$ with time implicit.

But the mathematical language of physics should make things as explicit as possible, for a deeper description and minimum ambiguity. Now, how do we make the updating of $n$ explicit in a diagram?

This is where graph theory comes in. As discussed in the previous section, we imagine the motion of $\mathcal{S}$ in $\Sigma$ as discrete updating of the coordinates in the manner,

$\dots, \left( n, \sigma \left( n \right) \right), \left( n+1, \sigma \left( n+1 \right) \right), \dots$

Firstly, let us call the coordinates at a given instant the \emph{node} at that instant, $\pmb{q} \left( n \right) = \left( n, \sigma \left( n \right) \right), \pmb{q} \left( n \right) \in \Sigma$.

In the evolution of $\mathcal{S}$, every node has a unique node immediately after it. To make this idea concrete, we define a function $E : \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma$,

$E = \left\{ \pmb{q} \left( n \right), \pmb{q} \left( n+1 \right) \vert n \in T \right\}$

Since $E$ is a function, every node $\pmb{q} \left( n \right)$ has a unique node it updates to, $E \left( \pmb{q} \left( n \right) \right) = \pmb{q} \left( n+1 \right)$.

To represent this information in the state update plot, we think of the position of $\mathcal{S}$ at each instant as a node, and every ordered pair of nodes as an arrow connecting the nodes. In other words, the arrows \emph{explicitly} represent how each state is mapped to its next state as $n$ updates.

\node[node] (1) at (axis cs:1,1) {$\pmb{q}_1$};

\node[node] (3) at (axis cs:3,3) {$\pmb{q}_3$};

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Update structure in the evolution of $\mathcal{S}$}
\end{figure}

(Here, subscripts on $\pmb{q}$ represent the corresponding values of $n$).

In the above picture of a system's evolution, there are two kinds of information:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Nodes} or \emph{vertices}, representing coordinates $\pmb{q} \left( n \right)$

  \item \emph{Arrows} or \emph{edges}, representing state updates with their direction
\end{enumerate}

The set of all nodes may be written as $V = \left\{ \pmb{q} \left( n \right) \vert n \in T \right\}$, and the set of edges as $E$, which we have already defined as a function from $\Sigma$ to itself. Then, all the information contained in figure $\ref{fig:2}$ may be packed into a single structure, called a \emph{graph},

$$G = \left( V, E \right)$$

Notice that $V \subseteq \Sigma$. Therefore, $E : \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma \implies E : V \rightarrow V$. This means that a graph is simply a set of vertices equipped with a function on itself. However, in common terminology, there is a condition for such a structure to be a graph: it cannot contain any ordered pairs of some vertex and itself. I.e., no arrow in a graph points from one vertex to itself.
